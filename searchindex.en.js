    "content": "A fully-featured LTI Tool Provider example can be found in /examples/provider. This document will walk through the details of how that application works.\nEnvironment The application expects the following environment variables (typically loaded from .env):\n​ .env # Express Session Secret SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret # Log Level # One of error warn info http verbose lti debug sql silly LOG_LEVEL=lti # Application Domain Name DOMAIN_NAME=https://ltidemo.home.russfeld.me # Admin Email Address ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@domain.tld # LTI Consumer Key and Secret LTI_CONSUMER_KEY=your_lti_consumer_key LTI_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_lti_consumer_secret # LTI 1.3 LMS Domain LTI_13_LMS_DOMAIN=https://canvas.instructure.com LMS Configuration - LTI 1.0 The settings above can then be used to configure this application in your learning management system (LMS) using LTI 1.0. Refer to your LMS documentation for specific details. An example using Canvas is given below.\nConsumer Key - LTI_CONSUMER_KEY from the app environment. Shared Secret - LTI_CONSUMER_SECRET from the app environment. XML Configuration URL - DOMAIN_NAME from the app environment followed by /lti/provider/config.xml by default. The URL can be configured in app.js as described below. Additional settings for the XML configuration can be set in the lti.js config file. Launch URL - DOMAIN_NAME from the app environment followed by /lti/provider/launch by default. The URL can be configured in app.js as described below. Domain - typically the DOMAIN_NAME from the app environment without the https:// at the front. Privacy Level - any option (“Public” provides all info, “Anonymous” omits most student info). XML Configuration Manual Configuration Once the application has been added to the course, an assignment can be created to direct students to the Launch URL used above.\nTo access the rest of the application, students and teachers should use the assignment configured in the learning management system to perform an LTI Launch as described below.\nLTI Toolkit Configuration The src/configs/lti.js file contains a minimal configuration for the LTI Toolkit for use as an LTI 1.0 Tool Provider:\n​ src/configs/lti.js /** * @file Configuration information for LTI Toolkit * @author Russell Feldhausen \u003crussfeld@ksu.edu\u003e * @exports lti an LTI Toolkit instance configured for this app */ // Import LTI Toolkit import LTIToolkit from \"lti-toolkit\"; // LTI Launch Handler import LTILaunch from \"../routes/lti-launch.js\"; // Initialize LTI Toolkit const lti = await LTIToolkit({ // Domain name for this application domain_name: process.env.DOMAIN_NAME, // Admin email address for this application admin_email: process.env.ADMIN_EMAIL, // Logging Level log_level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || \"silly\", // Use In-memory database for testing db_storage: \":memory:\", provider: { // Incoming LTI Launch Handler handleLaunch: LTILaunch, // LTI 1.0 Consumer Key and Shared Secret // for single LTI consumer setup key: process.env.LTI_CONSUMER_KEY, secret: process.env.LTI_CONSUMER_SECRET, }, }); export default lti; It configures a default LTI 1.0 Tool Provider using the domain, key and secret provided in the environment. It also configures the log level and tells the system to use an in-memory database instance. Finally, it directs the library to the LTILaunch function provided by one of the routes as the handler for incoming LTI Launch Requests.\nIntegrating Application Routes The app.js file creates a basic Express application with a minimal set of libraries and configuration.\n​ app.js // Import LTI configuration import lti from \"./configs/lti.js\"; // Other imports here // Create Express application var app = express(); // Other configuration here // Add LTI Toolkit Routes app.use(\"/lti/provider\", lti.routers.provider); The details of that file are omitted (read the source, you must), but the notable configuration is shown above. The configured LTI Toolkit is imported, and then the LTI Provider Router is connected to the application at the /lti/provider path. So, any incoming requests sent to that URL will be passed to the LTI Toolkit for handling. This matches the route used when configuring the tool in Canvas as shown above.\nLTI Launch Handler The LTI Launch Handler function will receive three parameters:\nlaunchData - an instance of the LTI Launch Data consumer - a Sequelize instance of an LTI Consumer from the database req - the incoming Express request object In the example project, we use the following LTI Launch Handler:\n​ src/routes/lti-launch.js /** * Handle an incoming LTI Launch Request * * @param {Object} launchData - an LTI Launch Data object * @param {Object} consumer - the LTI consumer object * @param {Object} req - the Express request object * @returns {String} a URL to redirect the user to after launch */ async function LTILaunch(launchData, consumer, req) { // We will store the LTI Launch Data and Consumer in the session for later use req.session.ltiLaunchData = launchData; req.session.ltiConsumer = consumer.toJSON(); // Determine if the user is a teacher or student const isStudent = parseRoles(launchData); // Record data in local data store updateDataStore(launchData, isStudent, req); // Redirect user based on role if (isStudent) { return \"/student\"; } else { return \"/instructor\"; } } Notice that we serialize the consumer parameter to JSON since it is provided as a Sequelize object instance.\nThis handler users two helper functions. The first will parse the incoming roles in the launchData object:\n​ src/routes/lti-launch.js /** * Parse LTI roles to determine user type * @param {Object} launchData - the LTI Launch Data object * @returns {Boolean} 'true' if user is a student, 'false' otherwise */ function parseRoles(launchData) { try { if (launchData.launch_type === \"lti1.0\") { // See https://www.imsglobal.org/specs/ltiv1p0/implementation-guide#toc-9 // LTI 1.0 roles are a long string if (launchData.user_roles.includes(\"Learner\")) { return true; } return false; } else if (launchData.launch_type === \"lti1.3\") { // See https://www.imsglobal.org/spec/lti/v1p3#role-vocabularies // LTI 1.3 roles are an array of strings if (launchData.user_roles.some((role) =\u003e role.includes(\"Learner\"))) { return true; } return false; } else { // Unknown LTI version console.error(\"Unknown LTI launch type:\", launchData.launch_type); return false; } } catch (error) { console.error(\"Error parsing roles:\", error); console.error(\"Roles data:\", launchData.user_roles); return false; } } It will simply return true if the role is a student, otherwise it will treat the role as an instructor. This may or may not be desired behavior for a production application.\nFinally, it also stores data about the incoming launchData in a shared data structure that is only stored in memory.\n​ src/routes/lti-launch.js /** * Update local data store * * @param {Object} launchData - the LTI Launch Data object * @param {Boolean} isStudent - 'true' if user is a student, 'false' otherwise * @param {Object} req - the Express request object */ function updateDataStore(launchData, isStudent, req) { // This is a placeholder function for updating a local data store // In a real application, you would implement logic to store // relevant launch data in your database or other storage system const courses = req.app.locals.dataStore.courses; const courseId = launchData.course_id; if (!courses[courseId]) { courses[courseId] = { name: launchData.course_name, label: launchData.course_label, assignments: {}, }; } const assignments = courses[courseId].assignments; const assignmentId = launchData.assignment_id; if (!assignments[assignmentId]) { assignments[assignmentId] = { name: launchData.assignment_name, lti_id: launchData.assignment_lti_id, grade_url: launchData.outcome_url, grades: {}, }; } if (isStudent) { const userName = launchData.user_name; const userId = launchData.user_lis_id; const userId13 = launchData.user_lis13_id; const outcomeId = launchData.outcome_id; assignments[assignmentId].grades[userId] = { name: userName, lis_id: userId, lis13_id: userId13, outcome_id: outcomeId, score: null, }; } } In practice, this would be replaced with appropriate code and logic to store this data in a database or other storage mechanism for the application. However, this data structure is instructive as it shows a minimal set of data that could be stored in order to track courses, assignments, students, and grades.\nStudent Grade Passback Once a student’s grade has been determined, it can be passed back to the learning management system (LMS) using the LTI Controller’s postGrade method:\n​ src/routes/student-grade.js /** * Handle LTI Student Grade Postback * * @param {Object} req - the Express request object * @param {Object} res - the Express response object */ async function StudentGradeHandler(req, res) { // Get LTI Launch Data and Consumer from session const launchData = req.session.ltiLaunchData; const consumer = req.session.ltiConsumer; let error = null; let message = null; // Get grade from form submission const grade = parseFloat(req.body.grade); if (isNaN(grade) || grade \u003c 0 || grade \u003e 1) { error = \"Invalid grade value.

In this example, those values are read directly from the user’s session.\nInstructor Grade Passback A more advanced example of submitting grades could involve the instructor providing grades after a student has completed an assignment:\n​ src/routes/instructor-grade.js /** * Handle LTI Instructor Grade Postback * * @param {Object} req - the Express request object * @param {Object} res - the Express response object */ async function InstructorGradeHandler(req, res) { // Get LTI Launch Data and Consumer from session const launchData = req.session.ltiLaunchData; const consumer = req.session.ltiConsumer; let error = null; let message = null; // Get form data const courseId = req.body.course; const assignmentId = req.body.assignment; const userId = req.body.user; const grade = parseFloat(req.body.grade); // Get assignment and user info from local data store // This is a placeholder function for updating a local data store // In a real application, you would implement logic to store // relevant grade data in your database or other storage system const courses = req.app.locals.dataStore.courses; const assignments = courses[courseId].assignments; if (isNaN(grade) || grade \u003c 0 || grade \u003e 1) { error = \"Invalid grade value. Must be between 0 and 1.\"; } else { // Post grade back to the LTI Provider // Build Grade Object const gradeObject = { // LTI Consumer ID consumer_id: consumer.id, // LTI 1.0 Outcome Information grade_url: assignments[assignmentId].grade_url, lms_grade_id: assignments[assignmentId].grades[userId].outcome_id, // Grade value between 0.0 and 1.0 score: grade, // LTI 1.3 User ID user_lis13_id: assignments[assignmentId].grades[userId].lis13_id, // Helpful Debugging Information debug: { // User Name user: assignments[assignmentId].grades[userId].name, // User ID (LTI 1.0 and LTI 1.3) user_id: assignments[assignmentId].grades[userId].lis_id + \" (\" + assignments[assignmentId].grades[userId].lis13_id + \")\", // Assignment Name assignment: assignments[assignmentId].name, // Assignment ID (LTI 1.0 and LTI 1.3) assignment_id: assignmentId + \"(\" + assignments[assignmentId].lti_id + \")\", }, }; if (lti.controllers.lti.postGrade(gradeObject)) { message = `Successfully posted grade of ${grade} back to the LMS.`; // Record grade in local data store assignments[assignmentId].grades[userId].score = grade; } else { error = \"Failed to post grade back to the LMS.\"; } } // Render instructor view with LTI Launch Data res.render(\"instructor.njk\", { title: \"LTI Tool Provider - Instructor View\", message: message, error: error, courses: req.app.locals.dataStore.courses, launchData: launchData, consumer: consumer, }); } In this example, the same data required to build a grade object is read from the shared data structure stored in memory. Again, in practice, this data would be read from a database or another storage mechanism, but this code should be instructive.\nLTI 1.3 Configuration Configuring an application to use the LTI 1.3 protocol is a bit more complex, and requires several steps in both the learning management system (LMS) as well as this tool. Detailed instructions and configuration information can be found at the /admin route in the example application, and also are discussed below.\nLTI 1.3 Dynamic Registration The simplest way to add an LTI 1.3 application to an LMS is the LTI 1.3 Dynamic Registration process.\nStep 1 - Add Application to Canvas In Canvas, this requires administrator access, so you may have to work with your Canvas administrator to accomplish this step. In Canvas, go to the Admin panel for the account used and find the Developer Keys page, then add a new LTI Registration.\nRegistration URL: DOMAIN_NAME from the app environment followed by /lti/provider/register by default. Once the registration is complete, click Enable and Close.\nStep 2 - Activate Application Once installed, the application must be made available to courses in Canvas. Click the View in Canvas Apps link next to the new LTI application, then click Edit and choose to make the application Available, then click Save. You can also restrict this to specific subaccounts or classes.\nStep 3 - Configure Assginment In Canvas, configure an assignment that uses an external URL (similar to working with LTI 1.0 Applications as shown below). This time, it will use the Target Link URI - typically the DOMAIN_NAME from the environment followed by /lti/provider/launch.\nFrom this point onward, students and teachers can access the LTI Demo Application through this Canvas assignment to perform an LTI 1.3 Launch.\nLTI Manual Registration Alternatively, LTI 1.3 applications can be registered manually in Canvas using the steps below.\nStep 1 - Add an LTI 1.3 Application in the LMS The first step is to add an LTI 1.3 application to the learning management system. In Canvas, this requires administrator access, so you may have to work with your Canvas administrator to accomplish this step. In Canvas, go to the Admin panel for the account used and find the Developer Keys page, then add a new LTI Key.\nRedirect URIs: DOMAIN_NAME from the app environment followed by /lti/provider/launch by default. Target Link URIs: DOMAIN_NAME from the app environment followed by /lti/provider/launch by default. OpenID Connect Initiation Url: DOMAIN_NAME from the app environment followed by /lti/provider/login JWK Method: Public JWK URL (this library only supports JWKS via URL) Public JWK URL: DOMAIN_NAME from the app environment followed by /lti/provider/jwks by default. The base of these URLs can be configured in app.js as discussed above.\nIn the LTI Advantage Services configuration, at a minimum the “Can create and update submission results for assignments associated with the tool” must be selected, which will allow this application to send grades back to the learning management system.\nAt the bottom, the privacy level may be set to any value. The “Public” option provides all data about students (name, email, image). Other privacy levels may omit some of this data.\nOnce the LTI Key is created, a Client ID is provided by Canvas. Make a note of this value for later. Also, make sure the LTI Key is enabled here.\nStep 2 - Add LTI 1.3 Application to a Course Once the LTI 1.3 Key is created, the application can be added to a course within the learning management system. In Canvas, this can be found on the Settings of a course on the Apps tab. Click the button to add a new application, and enter the Client ID from Step 1 above.\nOnce the application has been added to the course, click the menu next to the application and display the Deployment ID for the application. Save this value for later.\nStep 3 - Configure LTI 1.3 Settings Back in the LTI Provider Demo application, click the link on the homepage or navigate to the /admin page to access the LTI 1.3 configuration. On this page, enter the LTI 1.3 configuration information for your learning management system. Examples below are shown for Canvas using the configuration provided in the steps above.\nLTI 1.3 Client ID: From Step 1 Above LTI 1.3 Platform ID: This is usually just the URL of the LMS LTI 1.3 Deployment ID: From Step 2 Above LTI 1.3 JWKS Keyset URL: For Canvas, /api/lti/security/jwks LTI 1.3 Token URL: For Canvas, /login/oauth2/token LTI 1.3 Auth URL: For Canvas, /api/lti/authorize_redirect Step 4 - Configure LMS Assignment In Canvas, configure an assignment that uses an external URL (similar to working with LTI 1.0 Applications as shown below). This time, it will use the Target Link URI configured in Step 1 - typically the DOMAIN_NAME from the environment followed by /lti/provider/launch.\nFrom this point onward, students and teachers can access the LTI Demo Application through this Canvas assignment to perform an LTI 1.3 Launch.\nManaging LTI Consumers Within the sample application, the Admin Configuration handler gives a demonstration for using this library’s controllers to manage the LTI Consumers available within the application.\n​ src/routes/admin-config.js /** * Handle LTI Admin Launch * * @param {Object} req - the Express request object * @param {Object} res - the Express response object */ async function AdminConfigHandler(req, res) { let error = null; let message = null; // Get Form Data const data = { lti13: true, client_id: req.body.client_id, platform_id: req.body.platform_id, deployment_id: req.body.deployment_id, keyset_url: req.body.keyset_url, token_url: req.body.token_url, auth_url: req.body.auth_url, }; // Check if any required fields are missing const requiredFields = [ \"client_id\", \"platform_id\", \"deployment_id\", \"keyset_url\", \"token_url\", \"auth_url\", ]; const missingFields = requiredFields.filter( (field) =\u003e !data[field] || data[field].trim() === \"\" ); if (missingFields.length \u003e 0) { error = \"Missing required fields: \" + missingFields.join(\", \"); } else { // Update Consumer try { const returnValue = await lti.controllers.consumer.updateConsumer(1, data); if (!returnValue) { throw new Error(\"Consumer not found\"); } } catch (err) { error = \"Failed to update consumer: \" + err.message; } if (!error) { message = \"Successfully updated consumer.\"; } } // Get Updated LTI Consumer const consumers = await lti.controllers.consumer.getAll(); const consumer = consumers[0].toJSON(); // Get LMS Domain const lmsDomain = process.env.LTI_13_LMS_DOMAIN || \"https://canvas.instructure.com\"; res.render(\"admin.njk\", { title: \"LTI Tool Provider - Admin Configuration View\", consumer: consumer, lmsDomain: lmsDomain, domain: process.env.DOMAIN_NAME, key: process.env.LTI_CONSUMER_KEY, error: error, message: message, }); } This handler receives data provided in the LTI 1.3 configuration form, validates that all items are present (more validation could be performed as desired), and then it uses the Consumer controller provided through the library to update the default LTI Consumer (with ID 1) to include the LTI 1.3 configuration options. The Consumer controller provides additional methods to add and delete additional consumers as desired.\nWarning Be aware that, by providing both a key and secret as part of the provider configuration in the LTI Toolkit configuration (see src/configs/lti.js), all existing LTI consumers will be removed from the database each time the application is launched. So, those options must be removed and LTI Consumers must be configured directly through the controller if multiple consumers are desired.",

It also configures the log level and tells the system to use an in-memory database instance. In addition, it provides some configuration information about the LTI 1.0 Tool Consumer using the information provided in the environment. Finally, it directs the library to the postProviderGrade function provided by one of the routes as the handler for incoming LTI grade passback.\nIntegrating Application Routes The app.js file creates a basic Express application with a minimal set of libraries and configuration.\n​ app.js // Import LTI configuration import lti from \"./configs/lti.js\"; // Other imports here // Create Express application var app = express(); // Other configuration here // Add LTI Toolkit Routes app.use(\"/lti/consumer\", lti.routers.consumer); The details of that file are omitted (read the source, you must), but the notable configuration is shown above. The configured LTI Toolkit is imported, and then the LTI Provider Router is connected to the application at the /lti/consumer path. So, any incoming requests sent to that URL will be passed to the LTI Toolkit for handling. This matches the default route in the toolkit configuration; if this route is changed, it must also be provided in the configuration.\nAdding an LTI 1.0 Tool Provider Once the application is launched, the first step is to add an LTI 1.0 Tool Provider from the homepage. Each LTI 1.0 Tool Provider is a little different, so consult the instructions for adding that provider to your LMS. Currently this application only supports manually configured tools (configuration via XML is not currently supported).\nRequired settings:\nProvider Name - a memorable name for the LTI Tool Provider LTI 1.0 Shared Key - the shared key used with this provider LTI 1.0 Shared Secret - the shared secret used with this provider LTI 1.0 Launch URL - the launch URL for the LTI Tool Provider. LTI 1.0 Tool Provider Domain - the domain for the LTI Tool Provider Use Sections? - enable if the LTI Tool Provider requires special section configuration Currently this does nothing in the library itself, but may be useful for applications implementing LTI Tool Consumer functionality LTI 1.0 Custom Values - set custom values for the LTI 1.0 Launch Request (currently unsupported) LTI 1.0 Enabled - enable LTI 1.3 Tool Providers (currently unsupported) An example configuration for connecting to PrairieLearn is shown below:\nLTI 1.0 Tool Providers are added to the system using the Provider controller as shown in the configure handler.\n​ src/routes/configure.js /** * Handle LTI Tool Provider Configuration * * @param {Object} req - the Express request object * @param {Object} res - the Express response object */ async function ProviderConfigHandler(req, res) { let error = null; let message = null; // Get Form Data const data = { name: req.body.name, // LTI 1.3 is not supported lti13: false, key: req.body.key, secret: req.body.secret, launch_url: req.body.launch_url, domain: req.body.domain, // custom values are unsupported in this example custom: \"\", // use_section is optional use_section: req.body.use_section === \"true\", }; // Check if any required fields are missing const requiredFields = [\"name\", \"key\", \"secret\", \"launch_url\", \"domain\"]; const missingFields = requiredFields.filter( (field) =\u003e !data[field] || data[field].trim() === \"\", ); if (missingFields.length \u003e 0) { error = \"Missing required fields: \" + missingFields.join(\", \"); } else { // Create Provider try { await lti.controllers.provider.createProvider(data); } catch (err) { error = \"Failed to create provider: \" + err.message; } if (!error) { message = \"Successfully created provider.\"; } } // Get list of configured tool providers const providers = await lti.controllers.provider.getAll(); // Get secrets for each provider and convert to JSON-friendly format const providerData = []; for (const provider of providers) { const providerSecret = await lti.controllers.provider.getSecret( provider.id, ); providerData.push({ ...provider.toJSON(), secret: providerSecret }); } // Render index view res.render(\"index.njk\", { title: \"LTI Tool Consumer - Index\", domain: process.env.DOMAIN_NAME, providers: providerData, error, message, }); } Once an LTI 1.0 Tool Provider is configured, it will be listed on the index page. Click the link to access it.\nConfiguring an LTI 1.0 Launch Request A fully-configured LTI 1.0 Launch Request requires several pieces of information. Generally this information is part of the internal functionalty of the learning management system (LMS) that is implementing LTI 1.0 Tool Consumer functionality. For this example, we instead just use hand-entered values to simulate this process. In an actual LMS, most of this data would already be present.\nFor all of the items listed below, the key values should not be the sequentially autogenerated database IDs, as that may leak internal data from the LMS and allow malicious users to guess other valid values. Intead, these values should be unique and randomly generated, such as UUIDs or similar, but they should be consistent (i.e. a key should uniquely identify an item, and that item should always use the same key). Internally, this library uses the nanoid package to generate random ID values.\nContext - Generally, the context of an LTI launch refers to a course in the LMS Key - a uniquely identifiable key for the course Label - a short label for the course (e.g. “LTI 101”) Name - a long name for the course (e.g. “LTI Demo Course”) Resource - A resource in an LTI launch refers to a specific assignment within the LMS Key - a uniquely identifiable key for the assignment Name - a long name for the assignment (e.g. “LTI Demo Assignment”) User - Information about the user for the LTI launch. This tool does not currently support anonymous LTI launches. Key - a uniquely identifiable key for the user Email - the email address associated with the user. Most LTI Tool Providers use the email address to uniquely identify users within their own systems. Given Name - the given name, sometimes referred to as the first name, of the user Family Name - the family name, sometimes referred to as the last name or surname, of the user Launch Type - currently this tool only supports launching as either an “Instructor” or “Learner” role Gradebook Key - a uniquely identifiable key for the gradebook line item. This can be used to differentiate between individual launches to the same LTI Tool Provider, or to differentiate between launches to different LTI Tool Providers using the same context and resource keys. This sample application provides default values for all of these options in the form to configure the launch.\nOnce the launch is configured, click the “Submit” button to prepare the LTI 1.0 Launch page. This is handled by the provider-launch handler in the demo application. In short, it collects all of the form data and constructs the parameters for the generateLTI10FormData function in the LTI controller:\n​ src/routes/provider-launch.js /** * Provider Launch Handler for LTI Tool Consumer * * @param {Object} req - the Express request object * @param {Object} res - the Express response object */ async function ProviderLaunchHandler(req, res) { let error = null; let message = null; const providerId = req.params.id; // Get Provider const provider = await lti.controllers.provider.getById(providerId); if (!provider) { return res.status(404).send(\"Provider not found\"); } // Get Secret const providerSecret = await lti.controllers.provider.getSecret(provider.id); // Formatted provider including secret const providerData = provider.toJSON(); providerData.secret = providerSecret.secret; // Get Form Data const data = { context: { key: req.body.context_key, label: req.body.context_label, name: req.body.context_name, }, resource: { key: req.body.resource_key, name: req.body.resource_name, }, user: { key: req.body.user_key, email: req.body.user_email, given_name: req.body.user_given_name, family_name: req.body.user_family_name, name: req.body.user_given_name + \" \" + req.body.user_family_name, }, manager: req.body.manager === \"true\", gradebook_id: req.body.gradebook_id, }; // Check if any required fields are missing const requiredFields = [ \"context.key\", \"context.label\", \"context.name\", \"resource.key\", \"resource.name\", \"user.key\", \"user.email\", \"user.given_name\", \"user.family_name\", \"manager\", \"gradebook_id\", ]; const missingFields = requiredFields.filter((field) =\u003e { // Handle nested fields const fieldParts = field.split(\".\"); let value = data; for (const part of fieldParts) { value = value[part]; if (value === undefined) { return true; } } return ( value === undefined || value === null || value.toString().trim() === \"\" ); }); if (missingFields.length \u003e 0) { error = \"Missing required fields: \" + missingFields.join(\", \"); // Render provider view res.render(\"provider.njk\", { title: `LTI Tool Consumer - Provider: ${provider.name}`, provider: providerData, error: error, message: message, }); } else { // Store launch data in local data store updateDataStoreWithLaunch(data, providerData, req); // Create LTI Launch const launch = lti.controllers.lti.generateLTI10FormData( providerData.key, providerData.secret, providerData.launch_url, \"/provider/\" + providerData.id, data.context, data.resource, data.user, data.manager, data.gradebook_id, ); // Render template res.render(\"launch.njk\", { launch, }); } } The generateLTI10FormData function returns an object with 2 attributes:\naction : the LTI Launch URL to send the request to fields : a set of fields to be sent in the LTI Launch Sending an LTI Launch Request LTI 1.0 Launch Requests must be sent by the user’s browser. The easiest way to do this is by constructing a form on the webpage with only hidden fields, and then having the user click a button to submit the form to the LTI Launch URL of the LTI 1.0 Tool Provider. The form can also be configured to submit automatically if desired.\nThe launch.njk template demonstrates how to generate this page using the Nunjucks template engine.\n​ src/views/launch.njk \u003cform method=\"POST\" action=\"{{ launch.action }}\"\u003e {% for attr, value in launch.fields %} \u003cinput type=\"hidden\" id=\"{{ attr }}\" name=\"{{ attr }}\" value=\"{{ value }}\" /\u003e {% endfor %} \u003cinput type=\"submit\" value=\"LTI Launch\"\u003e \u003c/form\u003e Below is another helpful example for creating a similar page using a Vue.js component:\n\u003ctemplate\u003e \u003cdiv id=\"auto-form\"\u003e \u003cform v-if=\"form\" :action=\"form.action\" method=\"POST\"\u003e \u003cinput v-for=\"(value, key) in form.fields\" :key=\"key\" :name=\"key\" :value=\"value\" type=\"hidden\" /\u003e \u003cButton type=\"submit\" label=\"Launch Lesson\" severity=\"primary\" /\u003e \u003c/form\u003e \u003c/div\u003e \u003c/template\u003e Using the settings configured above, an LTI Launch page would contain the following object:\n{ \"fields\": { \"oauth_consumer_key\": \u003credacted\u003e, \"oauth_signature_method\": \"HMAC-SHA1\", \"oauth_timestamp\": \"1769290880\", \"oauth_nonce\": \"URY5gH_jRTpDDTsCH2MXP\", \"oauth_version\": \"1.0\", \"context_id\": \"contextkey\", \"context_label\": \"LTI 101\", \"context_title\": \"LTI Demo Course\", \"launch_presentation_document_target\": \"iframe\", \"launch_presentation_locale\": \"en\", \"launch_presentation_return_url\": \"/provider/1\", \"lis_outcome_service_url\": \"https://ltidemo.home.russfeld.me/lti/consumer/grade_passback\", \"lis_result_sourcedid\": \"contextkey:resourcekey:userkey:gradebookkey\", \"lis_person_contact_email_primary\": \"user@domain.tld\", \"lis_person_name_family\": \"FamilyName\", \"lis_person_name_full\": \"GivenName FamilyName\", \"lis_person_name_given\": \"GivenName\", \"lti_message_type\": \"basic-lti-launch-request\", \"lti_version\": \"LTI-1p0\", \"oauth_callback\": \"about:blank\", \"resource_link_id\": \"resourcekey\", \"resource_link_title\": \"LTI Demo Resource\", \"roles\": \"Learner\", \"tool_consumer_info_product_family_code\": \"lti-toolkit\", \"tool_consumer_info_version\": \"cloud\", \"tool_consumer_instance_contact_email\": \"admin@domain.tld\", \"tool_consumer_instance_guid\": \"deployment-001\", \"tool_consumer_instance_name\": \"LTI Toolkit Demo\", \"user_id\": \"userkey\", \"oauth_signature\": \u003credacted\u003e }, \"action\": \"https://pl.home.russfeld.me/pl/lti\" } The resulting page:\nClick the button to launch the LTI 1.0 Tool Provider.\nHandling Grade Passback At any time, the LTI 1.0 Tool Provider may provide updated grade information to our example program. That is received at the grade_passback route in the LTI Consumer Router, and then sent to the postProviderGrade function provided in the toolkit configuration as shown above. For this example program, this is handled in the post-grade handler:\n​ src/routes/post-grade.js /** * LTI 1.0 Grade Passback Handler for LTI Tool Consumer * * @param {string} providerKey the provider key * @param {string} contextKey the context (course) key * @param {string} resourceKey the resource (lesson or assignment) key * @param {string} userKey the user (student) key * @param {string} gradebookKey the gradebook key * @param {number} score the score to post (0.0 - 1.0) * @param {Object} req the Express request object */ async function postGradeHandler( providerKey, contextKey, resourceKey, userKey, gradebookKey, score, req, ) { // Store grade in the local data store updateLocalDataStoreWithGrade( req, contextKey, resourceKey, userKey, gradebookKey, score, ); // No need to return anything; library assumes success here } This function is called with a number of helpful parameters:\nproviderKey - the shared key for the LTI 1.0 Tool Provider, which can be used to look up the provider in the Provider controller with the getByKey method. contextKey - the unique key for the context (course) in the original LTI launch resourceKey - the unique key for the resource (assignment) in the original LTI launch userKey - the unique key for the user in the original LTI launch gradebookKey - the unique key for the gradebook line item in the original LTI launch score - the grade received, as a floating-point value between 0.0 and 1.0 req - the original Express request object This should be enough information to properly record the grade in the LMS gradebook. In this example application, it is just stored in an in-memory object for short-term tracking.\nViewing Grades This example application will display any grades received and stored in local memory in the grades path:\nThis matches the grade found in the LTI 1.0 Tool Provider:",

      <description>References https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/wiki/Quick-Start https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/blob/master/doc/docker/developing_with_docker.md Requirements This was configured for my local development machine. It has the following already installed/configured:&#xA;Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ The local user account was already added to the docker group A working Traefik proxy configured for home.russfeld.me with Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates enabled: https://traefik.io/traefik/ A world-routable DNS name home.russfeld.me directed to the IP address of the system Since this is running at home, it is port-forwarded through my local router and I use a Dynamic DNS system to keep this up to date A world-routable DNS name is required when testing some external LTI tools - localhost will not work Other options might be ngrok or another VPN There may have been other tools installed earlier that I did not account for here.</description>

    <title>LTI-Toolkit :: LTI Toolkit</title>
    <link>https://alt.cs.ksu.edu/lti-toolkit/index.html</link>
    <description>This project is yet another toolkit for developing LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) applications. It can act both as an LTI Tool Provider (a service integrated with a learning management system) using either LTI 1.0 or LTI 1.3, and it can also act as an LTI Tool Consumer (a learning management system) using LTI 1.0.&#xA;Limitations&#xA;Only supports JWKS keyset URLs for LTI 1.3 connections, not manually entered keys. (This best supports the typical Canvas use-case) Does not cache authentication keys received from LTI Consumers (LMSs) via LTI 1.3 - it will always request a new key (this is simple but inefficient) LTI 1.3 is not implemeneted within the LTI Tool Consumer features (therefore, it can only connect to other LTI Tool Providers using LTI 1.0 at this time) LTI 1.0 connections to external LTI Tool Providers don’t currently support custom variables Supports all Canvas privacy levels in LTI Launch Requests to Tool Providers Supports test students from Canvas in LTI Launch Requests Not currently tested or certified against the 1EdTech LTI Certification Tool Not currently tested against LTI Tool Consumers other than Instructure Canvas Does not currently send errors back to LTI Tool Provider when grades are received but cannot be posted Getting Started The package is currently not published to NPM but can be installed directly from GitHub:</description>

      <description>LTI Protocol Notes &amp; Documentation&#xA;When developing this project, I couldn’t find any good detailed examples for what these messages actually looked like in practice, especially the ones coming from Instructure Canvas. So, as I worked on this project, I carefully stored and documented these protocol messages. They can also be mostly exposed from this tool by enabling the silly logging level.&#xA;LTI 1.0 Tool Provider LTI 1.3 Tool Provider LTI Launch Data LTI 1.0 Tool Consumer LTI Registration</description>

LTI Protocol Notes & Documentation

When developing this project, I couldn't find any good detailed examples for what these messages actually looked like in practice, especially the ones coming from [Instructure Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/solutions/learning-management/k12). So, as I worked on this project, I carefully stored and documented these protocol messages. They can also be mostly exposed from this tool by enabling the `silly` logging level.
